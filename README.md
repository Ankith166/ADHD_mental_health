Use Cases

Working: workingVid https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ab_ZWCfhylvW2oCe5zd-kZc32wz8masQ/view?usp=drivesdk


Our project has the potential to make ADHD testing, which usually requires a few thousand rupees, accessible to anyone with a smart device
Automated mental health tracking will be especially beneficial for schools, Orphanages, shelters and anywhere where the child/caretaker ratio is too large

				Other ventures:

Game development – attention span tracking can be used to make games even more addictive
Meditation apps – attention span tracking can be used to devise a personalized meditative journey
AI integrated mental health screening as a cost-effective solution to Therapy


Future Additions:

Interface for working professionals in the psychiatric and psychology field, counsellors and teaching aids – will be accessible through OpenStreetMap API/ Places API 

Story based game – using Godot

Taking into account environmental factors -  through Face and Video recognition

Expansion of Mental Health Disorders domain 




Business Model:

Parents will pay a meagre monthly subscription of (~100 INR) after a free trial period

The game will ultimately have several stories to play through, we can collaborate with storytellers and writers to monetize some original story games, these will be available as In-App purchases

The working professional’s portal will be an interface for professionals to register themselves for consultancy: There will be a small registration fee involved with this.

Idea/Approach Details:

Mental Health tracking is growing to be one of the most sought-after fields inside Machine Learning, but most solutions in the market rely on timed surveys which does not account for the human bias associated with these surveys, especially for children.

So, how to eliminate this? How do we extract information about the human brain without asking it? 
By tricking it. Our idea is to extract information about a child’s mental wellbeing and attention span from their Game-playing behavior, currently we will look at primarily ADHD in children (ages 5 to 12).

What we propose: A two interfaced application that takes a survey from the child’s Guardian and tracks, assesses and provides mindful exercises to a child in the form of fables and small games. The idea is to not let the child be aware that they are being assessed, to them, it will only be a game.

The attention span of a child is measured from the duration of a game as well as the number of successful/ unsuccessful attempts the child required, this measure is then mapped to a diagnosis of ADHD.

Our model goes under periodic retrainings on the data collected when children use our webapp, creating a dataset that enriches itself with increased usage.
