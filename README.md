Our project has the potential to make ADHD testing, which usually requires a few thousand rupees, accessible to anyone with a smart device
Automated mental health tracking will be especially beneficial for schools, Orphanages, shelters and anywhere where the child/caretaker ratio is too large

				Other ventures:

Game development – attention span tracking can be used to make games even more addictive
Meditation apps – attention span tracking can be used to devise a personalized meditative journey
AI integrated mental health screening as a cost-effective solution to Therapy


Future Additions:

Interface for working professionals in the psychiatric and psychology field, counsellors and teaching aids – will be accessible through OpenStreetMap API/ Places API 

Story based game – using Godot

Taking into account environmental factors -  through Face and Video recognition

Expansion of Mental Health Disorders domain 




Business Model:

Parents will pay a meagre monthly subscription of (~100 INR) after a free trial period

The game will ultimately have several stories to play through, we can collaborate with storytellers and writers to monetize some original story games, these will be available as In-App purchases

The working professional’s portal will be an interface for professionals to register themselves for consultancy: There will be a small registration fee involved with this.
