Idea/Approach Details:

Mental Health tracking is growing to be one of the most sought-after fields inside Machine Learning, but most solutions in the market rely on timed surveys which does not account for the human bias associated with these surveys, especially for children.

So, how to eliminate this? How do we extract information about the human brain without asking it? 
By tricking it. Our idea is to extract information about a child’s mental wellbeing and attention span from their Game-playing behavior, currently we will look at primarily ADHD in children (ages 5 to 12).

What we propose: A two interfaced application that takes a survey from the child’s Guardian and tracks, assesses and provides mindful exercises to a child in the form of fables and small games. The idea is to not let the child be aware that they are being assessed, to them, it will only be a game.

The attention span of a child is measured from the duration of a game as well as the number of successful/ unsuccessful attempts the child required, this measure is then mapped to a diagnosis of ADHD.

Our model goes under periodic retrainings on the data collected when children use our webapp, creating a dataset that enriches itself with increased usage.
